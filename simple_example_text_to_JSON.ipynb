    "text = \"Solution Preparation: In this study, we prepared a solution for catalyst synthesis. First, the solutes copper nitrate and zinc chloride were accurately weighed (500.0 mg and 200.0 mg, respectively) using a high-precision balance. The solvents Water and Acetone were then added to the solutes in specific volumes (50.0 mL and 20.0 mL, respectively) in a glass vial. The mixture was stirred for 30 minutes at room temperature (25.0Â°C) under an inert gas atmosphere to ensure complete dissolution of the solutes. Finally, the solvent was evaporated using a rotary evaporator at reduced pressure, resulting in a solution with the desired composition. This process took approximately 2.5 hours to complete. The prepared solution was then used for further experimentation and analysis.\"\n",
